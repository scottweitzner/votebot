#VoteBot - a concise way to vote on anything you want in the slack messaging service
Everyone already love slack messenger, but we hate clutter. Slack allows us to participate in multiple chats at once without having to be bogged down by messages that don't concern us. But when it comes to choosing where to go to dinner, what to do on Friday night, or what movie to watch, the messages can add up quickly. With vote-bot users can create polls within channels and quickly come to a consensus without scrolling through pages of messages.
